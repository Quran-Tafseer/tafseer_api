# Quran Tafseer API [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/EmadMokhtar/tafseer_api.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/EmadMokhtar/tafseer_api) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/EmadMokhtar/tafseer_api/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/EmadMokhtar/tafseer_api)

Quran Tafseer REST APIs and Quran Text

## Idea

The idea is to create one REST API for all Quran Tanfseer/Interpretation for developers.
The idea came to me when I tried to search for REST API for Quran Tanfseer/Interpretation I couldn't find one,
and each Quran application web/mobile has its own Quran Tanfseer/Interpretation, so I thought it's good idea
to create one.
